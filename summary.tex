\section*{Summary}

Dr. Grima is doing pioneering research in the development of radar-inversion approaches for the characterization of planetary interfaces, including extensive applications over terrestrial ice sheets and ice shelves. His work involves theoretical enhancement of the radar signalâ€™s understanding and application/test on polar terrestrial analogs and planetary terrains. He did his Ph.D. using the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) data at Mars to study the polar ice deposits and surface characterization. He applies signal inversion techniques to different targets through various working groups. He is a co-I for the Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON) and an active collaborator on the ESA Radar for Icy Moon exploration (RIME) science team. He did two field seasons in Antarctica and two in Greenland to operate the airborne High Capability Radar Sounder (HiCARS) through the ICECAP program.
